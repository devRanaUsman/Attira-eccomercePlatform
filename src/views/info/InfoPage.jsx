      ["Our story", [`Attira began in 2019 as a small edit of twelve pieces — a blazer, a tote, a pair of loafers and the things that go with them. The idea was to build a wardrobe from the ground up: fewer, better items that work together and hold up to real life.`, `Today we design across women's and men's clothing, bags, shoes, accessories, beauty and home, but the brief hasn't changed. Every product starts with the same three questions: Will you reach for it often? Is it made well enough to last? Does it still feel right in five years?`]],
      ["What we stand for", [`Considered design over trend-chasing. Honest materials and construction you can see and feel. Fair prices that reflect what things actually cost to make well. And a shopping experience that respects your time, from clear sizing to easy returns.`]],
      ["How we make things", [`We work with a small group of long-term partner workshops in Portugal, Italy, Turkey and India. Most have been with us since the beginning. We visit regularly, pay on time, and develop products together rather than sending a spec sheet and waiting.`, `Our fabrics are chosen for hand-feel and durability first: organic and recycled cotton, responsibly sourced wool, linen, and leather from tanneries audited by the Leather Working Group. Read more on our <a href="/sustainability">sustainability page</a>.`]],
      ["The team", [`We're a team of 42 designers, makers, writers and customer-care specialists based between New York and Lisbon. If you write to us, a real person reads it — usually within a few hours.`]],

Arrives in 1–2 business days when ordered before 2pm ET.`, `<b>Collect from store</b> — Free. Ready in 2 hours at our Greene Street store during opening hours.`]],
      ["Processing times", [`Orders placed before 2pm ET on a business day ship the same day. Orders placed after 2pm, on weekends or on public holidays ship the next business day. During sale periods, allow one extra day.`]],
      ["Tracking your order", [`You'll receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking link as soon as your parcel leaves our warehouse. You can also check the status any time on our <a href="/track-order">Track Order</a> page using your order number and email.`]],
      ["International shipping", [`We currently ship to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the EU, Australia, the UAE, Pakistan, India, Japan and Singapore. International delivery takes 5–12 business days and costs are calculated at checkout. Duties and taxes for orders outside the US are included in the price shown at checkout — there's nothing extra to pay on delivery.`]],
      ["Missing or damaged parcels", [`If your tracking shows delivered but you can't find your parcel, check with neighbours and your building's mailroom, then get in touch within 7 days and we'll investigate with the carrier. Damaged on arrival? Send us a photo and we'll replace it or refund you right away.`]],

Select the items you're returning and a reason (this helps us improve, but it won't affect your refund).`, `3. Print the prepaid label or show the QR code at any drop-off point. US returns are free; international returns are deducted $9.95 from the refund.`, `4. Drop it off. Refunds are issued within 3–5 business days of the parcel reaching us.`]],
      ["Exchanges", [`Need a different size or colour? Choose "Exchange" instead of "Return" and we'll ship the replacement as soon as the return is scanned by the carrier — you don't have to wait for it to arrive back with us.`]],
      ["Conditions", [`Items must be unworn, unwashed and in their original condition with tags attached. Beauty products can be returned if unopened. Earrings, and items marked final sale, can't be returned for hygiene reasons unless faulty.`]],
      ["Faulty items", [`If something arrives damaged or develops a fault within 12 months of purchase, contact us with a photo. We'll repair, replace or refund — whichever you prefer.`]],
